2. Calculate the number of votes and percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
3. Determine which county had the largest number of votes.
4. Provide number of votes and precentage of total votes each candidate received.
5. Determine which candidate won the election, their vote count, and percentage of total votes received.

## Election Audit Summary
The script could be extremely useful in future elections. One example is counties could be changed to states for federal elections. Different filters could also be used to see how each candidate did in each county and then use that data for future campaigns. If there is a decrease of support in a county, future campaigns may want to allocate resources to promote the candidate in those areas.  The commission could then explore the lower producing counties to see if there is issue such as lack of access (transportation issues, available voting time, etc) or if it just lower in population. Again the script could be easily modified and useful in any further elections and a valuable resource for the commission.
